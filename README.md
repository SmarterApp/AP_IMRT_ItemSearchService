# IMRT Item Search Service

The Item Search Service searches across the IMRT Item Data.  The application does not have a user interface but allows searches through the HTTP API.

## Linked Applications
IMRT consists of three main projects with ingest being one of the three.  We recommend looking at the README's in the other project if you do not find what you need here.  The other two projects are:

* [IMRT Schema](https://github.com/SmarterApp/AP_IMRT_Schema)
* [IMRT Ingest](https://github.com/SmarterApp/AP_IMRT_ItemIngestService)
